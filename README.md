## Lessons Learned

I've learned and strengthen my knowledge during the development of this project. I've gain solid understanding of React(react hooks) Redux (actions, reducers), make API requests, posts, user authentication and more...   
Besides that, I learned server-side skills like creating APIs and uploading images.
